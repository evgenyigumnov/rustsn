**1. Cargo.toml:**

```toml
[package]
name = "multiply_params"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
# Add any dependencies your function may require
```

**2. src/lib.rs:**

```rust
pub fn solution(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a * b
}
```

**3. Build:**

```bash
cargo build
```

**4. Test:**

```bash
cargo test
```


## Detailed Explanation:

* **Cargo.toml:** This file defines the project metadata, including its name, version, and dependencies. We don't
need any specific dependencies for the `multiply_params` function. You can customize this based on your
requirements.

* **src/lib.rs:**  This file holds our `solution()` function implementation.
    * It takes two integer parameters (`a` and `b`).
    * It uses the multiplication operator `*`.
    * The function returns an integer representing the product of `a` and `b`.

* **Build:** This command builds the project, preparing it for execution.
  * You'll likely need to install Rust (e.g., using `rustup`) if you don't already have it.


* **Test:**  Running this command tests your code to ensure that it functions as intended.

**Additional Notes:**

* This solution is minimal; consider adding more functionality or complex testing in a real-world project.
* The `solution()` function can be extended to handle different data types (e.g., floats, strings) by changing the
input and output types accordingly.
