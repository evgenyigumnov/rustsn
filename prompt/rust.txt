Write Rust code that implements this function and name it `solution`. Also, write tests for this function.

Finally, create 2 files:

1. `src/lib.rs` (contains the implementation of the function and tests)
2. `Cargo.toml` (contains information about the project and dependencies)

You need to build this code and run the tests.

Formulate the solution in the following format:

**Cargo.toml**
```toml
Contents of Cargo.toml file
```

**src/lib.rs**
```rust
Contents of src/lib.rs file
```

**Build**
```bash
Commands for building code with tests (compiling all code and tests, add "--tests" parameter)
```

**Test**
```bash
Commands for running tests
```

In the end, there will be 4 blocks: **Cargo.toml**, **src/lib.rs**, **Build**, **Test**
