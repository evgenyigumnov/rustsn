Write PHP code that implements this function and name it `solution`.
Also, write tests for this function inside .

Finally, create 3 files:

1. `src/Solution.php` (contains the implementation of the function)
2. `tests/SolutionTest.php` (contains the implementation of tests) under the namespace `Tests`
3. `composer.json` (contains information about the project and dependencies)

You need to build this code and run the tests.

Formulate the solution in the following format:

**composer.json**
```json
Contents of composer.json file # name the project -> name: "sandbox/solution", add a test script -> "test": "vendor/bin/phpunit tests/*.php"
```

**src/Solution.php**
```php
Contents of src/Solution.php file # "<?php" at the beginning of the file and under the namespace `Solution`
```

**tests/SolutionTest.php**
```php
Contents of tests/SolutionTest.php file  # "<?php" at the beginning of the file
```


**Install**
```bash
Commands for installing dependencies # composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit --no-interaction
```

**Test**
```bash
Commands for running tests # composer test
```

In the end, there will be 5 blocks: composer.json, src/Solution.php, tests/SolutionTest.php, Install, Test.
